Here are some examples of the use of my Aleqsei ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/aleqsei),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/aleqsei)) Python wrapper for the Aqsis renderer.
You will need to have that installed before you can run these.

Each example script generates its output to a PNG file with the same basename as the
script. Thus, to run a script *script* and see its output, you could do something like

> ./*script* && display *script*.png

Alternatively, you can see the generated output on my [DeviantArt
account](https://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/77602143/alexsei-examples).
